  Development Notes:

  1. Basic registration! (center)

  - Prompt user to enter name (form, state) - center of page
  - Allow user to login if has unique name
  - Save name to local storage
  - Switch to game screen

  2. Game screen! (center)

  - Choose game type (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
  - Choose how many stages (1 stage is 10 sums)
  - Click start to begin

  3. Game! (slides to side, with progress on right? nav on top with name and logout)

  - Answer the sums
  - Progress counter on the right! Boxes filling in?
  - Tally up live & onscreen at end, with stats & message
  - 'Try again' & 'back to top' buttons


  * Some ideas

  - Add a TNT power for every 10 sums answered - allows you to skip an answer?
